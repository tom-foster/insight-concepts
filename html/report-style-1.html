				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p class="blurb">
					As an organisation our core purpose is to
					‘Develop and sustain a society that looks
					after its most vulnerable members, delivers
					appropriate, quality services at the right time,
					and seeks opportunities for economic growth
					and innovation.’
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Customer Service Strategy explains how
					we are transforming the services we provide to
					the people of Warwickshire. It is outlines our
					ambition for the quality and experience we
					want our customers to have.
				</p>
				<p>
					We want our customers to have the best
					possible experience when they use our
					services at a time when demand is increasing
					and the resources available for us to meet
					these reducing. In very simple terms we
					cannot continue to deliver services in the way
					we have so must find new delivery methods
					that meet both the demands and efficiencies
					required of us.
				</p>
				<p>
					In achieving this there is no compromise in our
					commitment to understanding our customers and
					their needs. We aim to increase our customers
					control over their experience with us whilst utilising
					digital channels as a way of delivering services in
					the most efficient way. We will ask those customers
					who are able to self-serve through an online
					account to do so, build our capacity using local
					ambassadors to provide support to help those
					who are less confident in doing this, or do not have
					access to technology, and utilise our most expensive
					methods of support for the most vulnerable.
					We will listen to our customers about their
					experiences with us and use their feedback to
					make real differences to our services. We want
					our services to be valued by those who use them.
					Customers should experience seamless services
					where they are able to access everything they need
					from us and our partners in one place.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are committed to providing services that are:
				</p>
				<ul class="mdl-list bullet-list">
					<li class ="mdl-list__item">Easily accessible</li>
					<li class="mdl-list__item">Cost effective</li>
					<li class="mdl-list__item">Simple to use</li>
					<li class="mdl-list__item">Streamlined</li>
					<li class="mdl-list__item">Convenient</li>
					<li class="mdl-list__item">Reliable</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Our future service delivery must be focused
					on simplifying the way customers access our
					services, understanding their journey with us,
					giving them control over the services they use,
					listening to and responding to their feedback.
					Services which can be delivered digitally will
					be, allowing expensive resources to be focused
					on those services which cannot be delivered
					digitally and focus on our most vulnerable
					customers.

					The Customer Vision
				</h2>
				<p>Information is accessed by customers through multiple channels and demand for Council services is effectively managed.</p>
				<p>The customer experience will be a positive one and is outlined below from a customer perspective:</p>

				<div class="customer-vision-1">
					<p><span>I want</span></p>
					<div class="stepped">
						<p>information, advice, service and help</p>						
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="customer-vision-2">

					<p><span>I get</span></p>
					<div class="stepped">
						<p>information, advice, service and help</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="customer-vision-1">
					<p><span>I know</span></p>
					<div class="stepped">
						<p>the information that you give me will be correct</p>
						<p> the service provided will be value for money</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="customer-vision-2">
					<p><span>I trust</span></p>
					<div class="stepped">
						<p>you to make things simple so that I can understand</p>
						<p>you to treat my information confidentially</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="customer-vision-1">
					<p><span>I feel</span></p>
					<div class="stepped">
						<p>that I have been understood</p>
						<p>you want to help me and that you care</p>
						<p>that my enquiry matters</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					We recognise that 'one size fits all' is not an appropriate response to our public service.
				</p>
				<p>
					We want improved, simplified,
					single affordable systems,
					buildings and staff that are
					customer focused and enable
					us to meet our customers’
					expectations. Key to this is the
					continued development of two
					key areas:
				</p>
				<ul class="mdl-list bullet-list">
					<li class="mdl-list__item"><span class="emphasised-bullet">Single point of entry to services (One Front Door)</span></li>
					<li class="mdl-list__item"><span class="emphasised-bullet">Customer Journey</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The One Front Door is the different ways/methods that customers use to access our services. It includes face-to-face, telephone, email/letter, automated phone, mobile and digital routes. In the next year we will be adding online individual customer accounts where customers can access and manage their services themselves through their single account, online live chat where we are able to text talk to people as they are looking at services online so we can help them and email alerts so people can receive information that is important to them.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Customer Journey is the experience a customer has with us in accessing a service. It includes how many contacts they have with staff and different parts of the organisation and what their experience was along the way. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We are already changing services so these are delivered online allowing us to sustain relevant services whilst delivering savings, this will continue as we shape our services for the future. The development of
					our self-service channel, live chat and email alerts will enable our customers to have greater control of the services they use. This will allow us to focus our most expensive telephone and face-to-face support
					on the most vulnerable whilst reducing and eventually closing the ways in which some of our services are currently accessed by customers. Both the One Front Door and understanding the journeys our customers take will be critical to getting this right. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We have already been consulting with our customers to understand what impact service transformation is having on them. We know that some customers do not have the skills, knowledge or confidence to use online services or access to equipment and the internet to make this possible. We will need to plan how they are supported to build their skills and confidence through a network of local facilities. We are confident the work we have started and our plan for the future will enable us to improve access to our services whilst also improving our customers’ experience.
